# Python Challenge: Two Analysis Scenarios
### *These sample scenarios showcase the use of Python and Jupyter Notebook to conduct analysis on particular datasets in order to draw conclusions and determine specific outcomes.*

#### PyBoss Analysis
For this challenge, TunaFirst company is developing Tuna 2.0, a world-changing snack food based on canned tuna fish. The company recently decided to purchase a new HR system, and unfortunately, the new system requires employee records be stored completely differently.  The primary task is to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert employee records to the required format by doing the following:
* The Name column should be split into separate First Name and Last Name columns.
* The DOB data should be re-written into DD/MM/YYYY format.
* The SSN data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.
* The State data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.

#### PyPoll Analysis
In this challenge, the task is to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. This python script analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
